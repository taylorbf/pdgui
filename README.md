# webpd gui prototype

this project uses [nexusui](http://www.nexusosc.com) to create a control interface for [webpd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd).

this is not a patching interface! it is only for control/performance. however, it is easy to use (see index.html) and will let you control your webpd patches without writing any extra code.

it supports many but not all interface objects. supports: number, toggle, bang, vslider, hslider, comment, message. does not support: vradio, hradio, symbol, probably others!

**note**: webpd is an excellent, stable, well-maintained library. the gui in this repository was hacked together in a day. this will not be as stable or well-maintained as webpd. however, it may prove useful for someone, who knows!
